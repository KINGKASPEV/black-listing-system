# Black-Listing-System

Admin Management of Blacklisted Items

## To-do:

1. Clone the repo
2. Fetch all branches.

- Run 'git fetch' on your gitbash/terminal

3. Branch out to develop branch. Run 'git checkout develop'
4. Branch out to your own branch.

- Run 'git checkout -b ft-taskName'

Note:

- Name your branches as:
  -- 'ft-taskname' for new features.

E.g. ft-login, ft-database-setup
-- 'bg-bug-fixed' for bug fixes.

E.g. bg-fix-add-user-bug, bg-fix-otp-bug

Your PR should be descriptive enough for the task you implement.

Best Practices

- Commit and push to your branch regularly. (Every day during your active sprint)
- Always Pull from the origin before pushing your code

E.g. Run 'git pull origin develop' after you've commited your changes, Just before pushing. Do this every time you made changes

- Resolve all conflicts before pushing your code to the remote repository.
- Communicate regularly with your team members.
